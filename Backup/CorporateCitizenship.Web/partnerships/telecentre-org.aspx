    <h2 class="miniheader orange">Networks</h2>
    
    <p>Networks give people who manage telecenters the raw materials they need to succeed: training, support, marketing, and technology. Networks also help them learn and innovate together so that they can use technology for the benefit of the communities they serve. More broadly, networks strengthen the entire telecenter ecosystem-acting as connectors between key players and sustaining relationships among telecenter leaders, researchers, and development partners.</p>
