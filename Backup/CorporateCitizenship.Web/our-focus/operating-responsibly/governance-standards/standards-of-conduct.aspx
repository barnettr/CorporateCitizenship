    <p class="intro">At Microsoft, we know that how we conduct ourselves and our business is as important as delivering outstanding products and services. The way we work with customers, partners, governments, vendors, and communities worldwide is fundamental to our success as a company.</p>
    
    <p>Microsoft is committed to responsible business practices. They are part of our core values and our daily work. That means being open about our business operations, transparent in all of our dealings with stakeholders, and compliant with the laws and regulations that apply to our business. It also means having the honesty to acknowledge when we fall short of those goals, and having the integrity to set things right. We strive to exceed legal requirements by conducting our business responsibly and with integrity.</p>
    
    <p>The Microsoft Standards of Business Conduct summarizes the regulatory requirements and business practices that guide our decision making and business activities. Every Microsoft employee is required to take a course on these standards and to sign a statement that indicates a personal intention to adhere to the collective commitment of ethical business behavior, and to legal and regulatory compliance.</p>
