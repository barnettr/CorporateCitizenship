    <p class="intro">At Microsoft, we have created a global culture of accountability through our core values and codes of conduct. These help govern our business practices, guide our employees in their professional decisions and interactions, and define Microsoft as a responsible industry leader and a good corporate citizen.</p>
    
    <p class="intro">We comply with or exceed governance codes used in the United States.</p>

        <p>The Office of Legal Compliance (OLC) supervises and oversees the establishment, implementation, and maintenance of effective and collaborative compliance and governance programs. As part of this, the OLC distributes a "newspaper of record" that covers corporate policy and training announcements. This is sent to every full-time Microsoft employee around the world.</p>

        <p>To facilitate the Microsoft Business Conduct and Compliance program, the OLC partnered with the Sales, Marketing, and Services Group (SMSG) Finance organization to further define a multidisciplinary, global compliance committee structure and processes.</p>
        
        <p>The structure includes a worldwide SMSG committee that is responsible for overseeing the regional compliance committees, such as those in Latin America (Latam), North America, Asia Pacific (APAC), Japan, and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA). There are also local compliance committees in select geographies. The committees are made up of representatives from Human Resources, Legal and Corporate Affairs, Finance, and SMSG Finance.</p>
        
        <p>The compliance committees are charged with working with the Office of Legal Compliance to:</p>
        
        <ul class="formatted-list">
