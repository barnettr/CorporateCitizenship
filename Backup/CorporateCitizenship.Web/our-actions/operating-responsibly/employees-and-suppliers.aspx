        <p>Our 90,000 employees drive our business, and we have a responsibility to create a respectful and rewarding work environment for them.</p>
        
        <p>The diversity of our employees differentiates Microsoft and drives our creativity. We try to ensure that the cultures and backgrounds of all employees are valued equally, which helps us attract and retain the best talent.</p>
        
        <p>We work hard to motivate, inspire and nurture our employees around the world.  We offer industry-leading training and development programs to our employees, investing nearly three percent of payroll budget in training and providing access to more than 2,300 courses, which range from management coaching to classes on how to better use specific software.</p>
        
        <p>To support the physical and mental well being of our employees as well as balancing their work and home life, Microsoft offers a range of exceptional benefits, including health care coverage, maternity and paternal leave, adoption assistance, fitness programs, financial education, and family backup care arrangements among others.  We also work with employees to create flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting and flex-time, and offer office-based conveniences. We also have well-developed contingency plans in the event of a pandemic are in place to protect our employee base.</p>
        
        <p>Employee compensation is another area of priority for Microsoft. We are committed to our pay-for-performance compensation approach, which is designed to attract and reward exceptional talent. Stock awards, bonus opportunities and service awards are a couple of ways we demonstrate this approach. Additionally, approximately ninety percent of employees participate in Microsoft stock programs.</p>
        
        <p>All Microsoft employees have a responsibility to act ethically in their work. We do not tolerate bribery or corruption. Every employee signs our Standards of Business Conduct, and receives training on ethical conduct and environmental practices as part of their new employee orientation.</p>

        <p>
            We also view our supply chain—which includes around 35,000 contractors, suppliers and vendors&#151;as an extension of the Microsoft business, so their conduct, conditions, and welfare are important to the sustainability of our business.
