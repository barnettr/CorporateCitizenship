				    Governance

			    <p>
				    Strong governance is a fundamental component of Microsoft’s business success. Our Board’s primary responsibility is to preserve accountability of management to Microsoft’s owners. In doing this, the Board believes that taking into account the interests of other stakeholders—employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and the many communities around the world where we do business—is important to achieving the long-term interests of Microsoft shareholders.
