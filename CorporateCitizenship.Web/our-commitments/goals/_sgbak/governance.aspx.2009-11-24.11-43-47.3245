    <p>Strong governance is a fundamental component of Microsoft’s business success, and we are proud of our actions and achievements in this area. Our Board’s primary responsibility is to preserve the accountability of management to Microsoft’s owners. In doing this, the Board believes that taking into account the interests of other stakeholders—employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and the many communities around the world where we do business—is important to achieving the long-term interests of Microsoft shareholders.</p>
    
    <p>Specific achievements include:</p>
    
    <ul class="formatted-list">
	    
	    <li>Microsoft outperforms 98.2% of the companies in the S&P 500, and every company in the Software and Service grouping, according to RiskMetrics Group/Institutional Shareholder Services.</li>
	    
	    <li>We scored 8.5 out of 10 when Governance Metrics rated our corporate governance standards for: Board Accountability, Financial Disclosure and Internal Controls, Shareholder Rights, Remuneration, Market for Control, and Corporate Behavior.</li>
	    
	    <li>Microsoft scored ‘B’ on a scale of ‘A’ to ‘F’ according to The Corporate Library. The rating methodology was based on an assessment of Board Composition and Succession Planning, CEO Compensation, Takeover Defenses, and Board-level Accounting Concerns.</li>
