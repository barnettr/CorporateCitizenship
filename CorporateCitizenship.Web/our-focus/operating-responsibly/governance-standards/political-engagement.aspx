    <p class="intro">Microsoft has a policy and code of conduct that governs corporate political spending, transparency, and trade association dues. In the United States we run the Microsoft Political Action Committee, which informs its members about decisions made by government officials that affect our business, and enables Microsoft employees and shareholders to jointly support candidates for public office.</p>

        <h2 class="miniheader green">Political Donations</h2>
        
        <p>The Microsoft Political Action Committee (MSPAC) was created in 1988 to enable Microsoft employees and shareholders to participate more effectively in the political process in the United States. MSPAC informs its members about important issues and decisions made by government officials that can affect Microsoft business. The committee also provides an opportunity for members to jointly support public policy positions that are important to Microsoft and the software industry.</p>
        
        <p>MSPAC is a bipartisan organization that contributes to the campaigns of federal, state, and local candidates. MSPAC typically supports candidates who share Microsoft views on public policy, serve as congressional or legislative leaders, represent districts or states where Microsoft has a major business presence, or serve on committees that have jurisdiction over legislation that is important to the company.</p>

        <h2 class="miniheader green">MSPAC Process</h2>
        
        <p>A committee of Microsoft employees meets regularly to evaluate candidates' public policy positions on issues that are relevant to Microsoft business or of particular interest to the computer software industry. The MSPAC Steering Committee, composed of senior managers in Legal and Corporate Affairs at Microsoft, then decides which candidates and campaigns MSPAC will support. In 2008, MSPAC made political contributions totaling US$724,700.</p>
        
    </div>
    
    <div class="panel">
    
        <h2 class="miniheader green">MSPAC Participants</h2>
        
        <p>All Microsoft employees and shareholders who are U.S. citizens or hold a permanent residence visa (green card) are eligible to participate in MSPAC. They and their spouses can make individual contributions to MSPAC of up to US$5,000 annually. The minimum annual contribution for MSPAC members is US$50. Joining MSPAC is voluntary, and decisions about membership do not affect an employee's career at Microsoft.</p>
        
        <p>Microsoft encourages its employees to participate in the political process and provides opportunities for them to learn about important issues. As part of that effort, MSPAC conducts voter registration drives at larger Microsoft facilities in the United States. It also sponsors a monthly Speaker's Series on Microsoft campuses to encourage discussion among MSPAC members and political leaders&#151;state, federal, and international&#151;on a range of public policy issues.</p>

    <div class="panel">
    
        <h2 class="miniheader green">Corporate Contributions</h2>
        
        <p>Under U.S. law, corporations cannot support candidates for federal office. Many states allow corporate donations to state and local candidates or to ballot issue campaigns. As a corporation, Microsoft makes political contributions to support candidates and ballot measures that are consistent with the company's public policy agenda and business interests. In 2008, Microsoft corporate contributions to state and local political campaigns totaled US$371,200.</p>
        
        <p>As of July 2005, Microsoft has made no corporate contributions to any noncandidate or nonparty political committee organized under section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code. </p>
