			<h3>
				Healthcare
			</h3>
			<p>
				Using technology and software to deliver healthcare can help patients access treatment, improve diagnoses, and save healthcare workers time, while cutting unnecessary costs and inefficiencies. Microsoft&rsquo;s vision is for health IT to improve the quality of healthcare, increase access and reduce costs while giving people more control over their health information.

			<h3>
				Energy &amp; Environment
			</h3>
			<p>
				IT makes our economy more energy efficient, and enables individuals, businesses, and governments to understand their environmental impact and reduce their energy use. We&rsquo;re developing technologies that let people monitor and improve their use of limited resources like energy and water. We&rsquo;re also supporting government policies that promote energy efficiency, incentivize research, and help create &ldquo;green&rdquo; technology and jobs.

			<h3>
				Workforce Development
			</h3>
			<p>
				The skills workers need to stay competitive are changing rapidly. Many new jobs&mdash;in both traditional and new industries&mdash;now require computer literacy, and so Microsoft partners with governments and non-government organizations to provide free or low-cost technology skills training to help displaced workers re-enter the workforce. We also support organizations that offer workers greater mobility and lifelong learning opportunities.

			<h3>
				Future of Government
			</h3>
			<p>
				We work with governments around the world to enhance their day-to-day operations and better connect public services to their citizens. IT allows governments to serve citizens better, by improving the delivery of public services, speeding and smoothing communication between agencies and citizens, and increasing transparency.
