	<h1>Europe</h1>
	<h2>Austria</h2>
	<h3>Oesterreichische Caritas-Zentrale</h3><p>
	As many as 200,000 socially disadvantaged Austrian women live in poverty and are unlikely to be able to afford a computer or learn basic technology skills. IT skill training has the potential to help these women enter the labor market. Through the Caritas-Microsoft Computer-Alphabet for Women project (whose mission is to help marginalized individuals improve their lives), new opportunities for women in social need are being created in Vienna, Styria, and Burgenland. Funding from a Microsoft Unlimited Potential grant will continue to support the Computer-Alphabet project in partnership with the Austrian Labor Market Service&rsquo;s Ministry for Women and Fujitsu-Siemens. In 2009, 220 women will be trained and a new &quot;computer-kiosk&quot; will enable an additional 2,000 individuals and job seekers to benefit.</p>

	<h2>Belgium</h2>
	<h3>UP-DoIT Partnership</h3>
	<p>Eight percent of women in Belgium between the ages of 25 and 49 are unemployed. Of these women, the non-European residents have a much higher unemployment rate than their European counterparts. In response to growing issues of immigrant social exclusion and long-term immigrant unemployment, eleven organizations united in 2006 under the Do It initiative to offer programs in both French-speaking and Dutch-speaking regions of Belgium. Through their combined training resources and network of over 70 community technology centers around the country, the project, led by Interface 3, will provide IT skills training to an additional 3,500 people in 2009. This is the sixth year that Microsoft Unlimited Potential has supported this successful program with funding, curriculum, and software.</p>

	<h2>Bosnia and Herzegovina</h2>
	<h3>Research and Organizational Development Association</h3>
	<p>The Research and Organizational Development Association (RODA) is implementing a Computer Literacy for Social Inclusion project that addresses the need for computer literacy among the underserved in Bosnian society.

ICentres relies on a national network of more than 115 telecenters established through collaboration with the Bulgarian Government, United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and Microsoft. The project uses the localized Microsoft Unlimited Potential Learning curriculum and the latest tools in distance education to train more than 300 trainers and 19,000 disadvantaged citizens. The ICentres network is anticipated to grow to 180 centers in the next year.</p>

	<h2>Czech Republic</h2>
	<h3>Charta 77 Foundation</h3>
	<p>The Czech Republic has made positive strides in creating an information technology in the economy over the past years. Despite improvements, there are still a significant number of socially or economically disadvantaged communities that have very limited access to information technology or the skills to use it well. The Charta 77 Foundation&rsquo;s PCs Against Barriers program provides socially excluded citizens, such as people with disabilities or the elderly, with information and communications technology skills and infrastructure to improve their economic and social opportunities. Building on a strong and long-term cooperation, Charta 77 and Microsoft will extend the PCs Against Barriers effort by creating a network of additional community technology centers (CTCs) and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to train a broader portion of the community. This project aims to train more than 10,000 people in the next three years with 36 NGOs as active participants in the network.</p>

	<h2>Denmark</h2>
	<h3>Foreningen Nydansker</h3>
	<p>The Association for New Danes&#x27; (FND) overall purpose is to aid new Danes, or recently settled immigrants in four Copenhagen suburbs, to integrate into the labor market. In spite of an excellent social welfare system, this group does not currently benefit from information and communications technology skills training in their community. FND will work in close collaboration with Red Cross Youth and KAB (an umbrella nongovernmental organization for social housing areas in the Copenhagen area that provides the training premises in all suburbs). Microsoft Unlimited Potential funding will support training of master trainers who will train volunteer trainers at the four centers. Trainees will also receive specific job-searching skills and, where feasible, mentoring support to improve their prospects for entering the job market. FND&rsquo;s goal is to expand from 4 to 30 training centers.</p>

	<h2>Estonia</h2>
	<h3>Estonian Chamber of Commerce and Industry</h3>
	<p>Estonia still confronts challenges in matching skilled talent to employers&#x27; needs. Young graduates, even after finishing university studies, often lack the expertise that companies seek. As a result, unemployment among young people is exceptionally high. The Estonian Chamber of Commerce is acutely aware of this problem and focuses on supporting training that will result in more jobs for new graduates. In cooperation with the State Labor Market Board, the Chamber is sponsoring IT training for graduates who need additional skills to secure employment. With Microsoft Unlimited Potential funding, the program will extend training to disadvantaged students, ensuring that the opportunities provided are available to those who most need additional support to get ahead in the knowledge economy.</p>

	<h2>Finland</h2>
	<h3>Finnish Association of People with Physical Disabilities</h3>
	<p>In Finland, 10 percent of the people have a disability that hampers their everyday life, and only 17 percent of these people are employed. The ARGOW project in Finland is successfully demonstrating how creative solutions and combined resources can significantly reduce the digital divide&#x27;s effect on people with disabilities. ARGOW unites four national nongovernmental organizations that represent people with disabilities: the Finnish Association of People with Mobility Disabilities, the Finnish MS Society, the Kynnysry/Threshold Association, and the Finnish Federation for the Visually Impaired. Through an innovative mobile classroom and a network of 37 community learning centers, the project aims to train 5,000 people with disabilities in IT skills and to reach people in the most remote areas of the country.

Now entering the second year of Microsoft Unlimited Potential funding, the program will build upon six initiatives linked to new technologies being developed with local government. These activities range from computer refurbishment, training, and work experience for the unemployed. The most effective measures in helping people find employment will be adopted and replicated at the national level.</p>


	<h3>Association Emma&uuml;s</h3>
	<p>Established in 1953, Emma&uuml;s is a nongovernmental organization renowned throughout France for its work combating social exclusion and improving the lives of the poor and homeless. With 40 centers across the Paris region, Emma&uuml;s has developed daily care centers, temporary accommodation, and housing facilities, as well as literacy training, health care, food, and programs for young people and families. In 2003, Microsoft France and Emma&uuml;s began a partnership to open a computer-learning center in one of the Emma&uuml;s centers in Paris. The center provides free and continuous public access and offers basic technology skills training, assistance in finding jobs, and guidance on administrative paperwork. Microsoft has since worked in partnership with Emma&uuml;s to open 14 new community technology centers supported by volunteer trainers at Emma&uuml;s centers around the Paris area. The project&rsquo;s 2009 goal is to create six new centers and train 3,000 people.</p>

	<h2>Germany</h2>
	<h3>IT Bildungsnetz e.V.</h3>

	<h2>Italy</h2>
	<h3>Fast Track to IT</h3>
	<p>Across the religious divide in disadvantaged communities in Northern Ireland, technology is playing a key role in bringing women together to help them enter the labor market. Only 58 percent of women are employed in Northern Ireland. Through the Fast Track to IT (FIT) training initiative that has been successfully running in the Republic of Ireland for several years, Microsoft Unlimited Potential funding will extend the program in Northern Ireland in six new areas. FIT is working with local nongovernmental organizations and government agencies to replicate their training model, targeting long-term unemployed in community technology centers and training institutions across Northern Ireland. The 2009 grant will ensure training for approximately 1,000 long-term unemployed and improve their opportunities for employment.</p>



	<h3>Associazione degli Interessi Metropolitani</h3>

	<h2>Czech Republic</h2>
	<h3>Charta 77 Foundation</h3>
	<p>The Czech Republic has made positive strides in creating an information technology in the economy over the past years. Despite improvements, there are still a significant number of socially or economically disadvantaged communities that have very limited access to information technology or the skills to use it well. The Charta 77 Foundation&rsquo;s PCs Against Barriers program provides socially excluded citizens, such as people with disabilities or the elderly, with information and communications technology skills and infrastructure to improve their economic and social opportunities. Building on a strong and long-term cooperation, Charta 77 and Microsoft will extend the PCs Against Barriers effort by creating a network of additional community technology centers (CTCs) and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to train a broader portion of the community. This project aims to train more than 10,000 people in the next three years with 36 NGOs as active participants in the network.</p>

	<h2>Denmark</h2>
	<h3>Foreningen Nydansker</h3>
	<p>The Association for New Danes&#x27; (FND) overall purpose is to aid new Danes, or recently settled immigrants in four Copenhagen suburbs, to integrate into the labor market. In spite of an excellent social welfare system, this group does not currently benefit from information and communications technology skills training in their community. FND will work in close collaboration with Red Cross Youth and KAB (an umbrella nongovernmental organization for social housing areas in the Copenhagen area that provides the training premises in all suburbs). Microsoft Unlimited Potential funding will support training of master trainers who will train volunteer trainers at the four centers. Trainees will also receive specific job-searching skills and, where feasible, mentoring support to improve their prospects for entering the job market.

	<h2>Russia</h2>
	<h3>Project Harmony International Inc.</h3>
	<p>Improving economic opportunity for disadvantaged groups is a critical challenge for communities throughout the vast Russian Federation. The advantages that IT knowledge provides in competing for jobs and work-place advancement are especially valuable assets for those who want and need to improve their economic prospects in our increasingly knowledge-based economy. The Information Dissemination and Equal Access (IDEA) project, initiated by Project Harmony (PH) International and Microsoft Russia, brings e-skills training and support to underserved communities throughout the country, thereby changing the economic prospects for thousands of people who have not yet had access to the potential that technology offers. Through a network of locally hosted, supported, and committed IDEA Centers managed in partnership with libraries, universities, and other nonprofits, and with the support of regional and municipal authorities, IDEA learning centers provide critical e-skills to the communities. Every month, each center provides 26 hours of free training in Unlimited Potential curriculum and capacity-building themes designed to best suit the target population in that specific community, providing the most relevant trainings possible. Over the three-year program, the IDEA network has grown to 59 centers throughout Russia&mdash;many of them self-sustaining&mdash;and IDEA centers have trained more than 42,500 participants and benefited more than 207,000 people in Russia. In 2009, approximately 16,500 people will learn the skills necessary to increase their employability, and more than 70,000 will benefit from the project activities.</p>

	<p>After more than a decade of economic and social decline, Serbia is now on the right path to join the EU and fully participate in the modern world. But the past has left a lot of scars on Serbian society. Thousands of refugees and internally displaced people still present major challenges, needing reintegration and services to help them become economically productive. The International Aid Network (IAN) in Serbia is working hard to educate refugees and other socially vulnerable groups, giving them a chance for a new beginning. IAN supports these individuals by teaching them to use information technologies and acquire other skills so that they can create new opportunities for themselves. By helping IAN in its education programs with software and donations, Microsoft is actively participating in creating opportunity for these people. IAN provides courses on computers, social skills, entrepreneurship, and the English language. More than 2,500 people have participated.</p>
