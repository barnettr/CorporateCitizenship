	<h2 class="miniheader orange">ProGres Refugee Registration Platform</h2>

	<p>During the Kosovo refugee crisis in 1999, UNHCR, Microsoft employees, and other partners developed a mobile registration system to provide more than a half million refugees with new identification documents. This system evolved into the ProGres database, which has since been implemented globally. </p>

	<p>Through ProGres, refugees are systematically registered upon arrival. This helps improve refugee-camp management by accurately determining the size and composition of refugee populations and their need for assistance. ProGres issues identification cards, records addresses for refugees living outside camps, issues voluntary repatriation forms, and identifies people with special needs, such as unaccompanied minors or the elderly. </p>

<ul class="links">
	<li>ProGres creates a standardized system for refugee registration, replacing dozens of old, incompatible databases.</li>
	<li>ProGres is used by 300 camps and 72 countries, including 32 countries in Africa.</li>
	<li>ProGres has been used by 5 million refugees.</li>
