    <h2 class="miniheader orange">Charity of Choice</h2>

    <p>NPower recently launched an exciting new effort to become the "Charity of Choice" for corporate CIOs nationwide. Through the development of a unique, online portal, NPower will make it easier to match skilled and trusted corporate IT volunteers with nonprofits across the country. This will help address the critical need among nonprofits to access and use appropriate technology more effectively so that they can better achieve their missions.</p>

    <h2 class="miniheader orange">Microsoft Partnership</h2>

    <p>With the help of Microsoft, the first NPower opened its doors in Seattle, Washington, in 1999, providing hands-on technology assistance to nonprofits in the Puget Sound region. In response to the need for similar services in other communities, NPower partnered again with Microsoft in 2000 to open other affiliates around the country. The NPower network is now headquartered in New York.</p>
    
    <p>Since 1999, Microsoft has donated more than $20 million to NPower, in addition to countless volunteer hours and more than $30 million in software retail value to NPower and its clients.</p>
